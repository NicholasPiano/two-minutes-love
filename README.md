Distributed collective charitable activity server written in Django

There are two parts:
1. A web application written in Django
2. An ios/android application that acts as a browser frontend for the charity.

The web application runs the stats engine and the distribution system. The ios frontend allows to user to quickly access and manipulate their account and perform actions with other users.
